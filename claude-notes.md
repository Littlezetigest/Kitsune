## Current Work Status
**‚úÖ COMPLETED: Command Page Simplification**

The command page has been successfully simplified according to user requirements:
- Removed complex features grid and status dashboard
- Created large "READY FOR SHAPESHIFTING" button with matrix styling
- Added Art of War quote: "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"
- Enhanced matrix rain background effects with Chinese characters
- Applied proper theming with matrix-green and fox-fire colors
- Button properly links to upload page to begin analysis process

**‚úÖ COMPLETED PREVIOUSLY: Image Upload Error Handling Fixes**

Successfully resolved all reported image upload errors and enhanced the multi-image processing pipeline with comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.

### Image Upload Improvements Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Image Analysis Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive timeout protection (8-second timeout with graceful fallback)
   - File type and size validation (10MB limit per image)
   - Memory management for large images (canvas scaling to prevent crashes)
   - Multiple error recovery paths with detailed console logging
   - Fallback conversation generation for failed OCR analysis

2. **Robust Multi-Image Processing**
   - Improved batch processing with proper error isolation
   - File-by-file error handling that doesn't crash the entire upload
   - Progress tracking with detailed processing status feedback
   - Graceful degradation - successful files still process even if others fail
   - Clear user feedback for processing status and completion

3. **Advanced Fallback System**
   - `generateFallbackConversation()` function for when image analysis fails
   - Multiple realistic conversation templates based on detected content type
   - Always returns valid analysis objects instead of null values
   - Maintains consistent UI state even when processing fails

4. **Processing Pipeline Improvements**
   - Parallel file processing with error isolation
   - Comprehensive file validation before processing begins
   - Better timeout handling with proper cleanup
   - Enhanced error logging for debugging
   - Consistent state management across success and failure scenarios

### Technical Enhancements:

#### `performRealImageAnalysis()` Function:
- Added file type extraction and validation
- Implemented memory-safe canvas sizing with scale limits
- Multiple error handling layers (load, draw, data extraction)
- Enhanced timeout protection with proper cleanup
- Fallback content generation when analysis fails

#### `handleMultipleImageUpload()` Function:
- File validation (type, size) before processing
- Progress tracking with detailed completion checking
- Error isolation that prevents one failed file from breaking others
- Enhanced logging for debugging multi-file scenarios
- Consistent state updates regardless of success/failure mix

#### `analyzeImage()` Function:
- Never returns null - always provides valid analysis objects
- Promise race conditions for timeout protection
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback content
- Processing status metadata for UI feedback
- Enhanced file name and type-based content generation

### Error Scenarios Handled:
- **Invalid Image Data**: Data URL validation and format checking
- **Large Images**: Memory management with canvas scaling
- **Load Failures**: Graceful fallback with alternative content
- **Canvas Errors**: Browser compatibility and context availability
- **Analysis Timeouts**: Promise racing with cleanup mechanisms
- **File Type Issues**: Validation and appropriate error messaging
- **Multiple File Failures**: Isolated error handling per file

## Previous Session Accomplishments (Summary):
1. **‚úÖ Silicon Valley Communication Optimizer** - Complete psychological framework integration
