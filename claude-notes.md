**‚úÖ COMPLETED PREVIOUSLY: Image Upload Error Handling Fixes**

Successfully resolved all reported image upload errors and enhanced the multi-image processing pipeline with comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.

### Image Upload Improvements Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Image Analysis Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive timeout protection (8-second timeout with graceful fallback)
   - File type and size validation (10MB limit per image)
   - Memory management for large images (canvas scaling to prevent crashes)
   - Multiple error recovery paths with detailed console logging
   - Fallback conversation generation for failed OCR analysis

2. **Robust Multi-Image Processing**
   - Improved batch processing with proper error isolation
   - File-by-file error handling that doesn't crash the entire upload
   - Progress tracking with detailed processing status feedback
   - Graceful degradation - successful files still process even if others fail
   - Clear user feedback for processing status and completion

3. **Advanced Fallback System**
   - `generateFallbackConversation()` function for when image analysis fails
   - Multiple realistic conversation templates based on detected content type
   - Always returns valid analysis objects instead of null values
   - Maintains consistent UI state even when processing fails

4. **Processing Pipeline Improvements**
   - Parallel file processing with error isolation
   - Comprehensive file validation before processing begins
   - Better timeout handling with proper cleanup
   - Enhanced error logging for debugging
   - Consistent state management across success and failure scenarios
