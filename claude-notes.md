2. 2ad00c5 - feat: integrate Meta-Narrative Analyzer with comprehensive Convex backend

## Current Work Status
**✅ COMPLETED: Meta-Narrative Analyzer Implementation & Backend Integration**

Successfully implemented the comprehensive Meta-Narrative Analyzer system with full Convex backend integration. This completes all major features from the user's original request list.

### Features Implemented:
1. **Complete Meta-Narrative Analyzer** (`/meta-analyzer` route)
   - Comprehensive temporal analysis of investor relationship evolution
   - Phase-based relationship tracking (Initial Contact → Relationship Building → Due Diligence → Decision Phase)
   - Psychological state mapping with trust levels, engagement scores, and resistance factors
   - Critical moment identification with impact analysis and psychological shifts
   - Predictive scenario modeling with probability assessments (Optimal Path 35%, Standard Path 45%, etc.)
   - Strategic recommendations with priority levels and expected impact
   - Communication pattern analysis across relationship phases
   - Trust and engagement evolution tracking with visual trajectory mapping
   - Multiple timeframe analysis capabilities (1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, all time)
   - Advanced psychological framework integration

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Complete Convex backend functions for advanced psychological analysis
   - metaNarrative.ts with comprehensive analysis engine (6-phase analysis system)
   - Dynamic conversation selection from user's uploaded data
   - Real-time analysis generation with confidence scoring
   - Advanced schema support for complex analysis data structures

3. **Navigation Integration**
   - Added META-ANALYZER link to both desktop and mobile navigation menus
   - Positioned between OPTIMIZER and YOUR PROFILE sections
   - Route tree automatically regenerated to include new route

### System Architecture:
- **Conversation Selection**: Dynamic selection from user's uploaded conversations
- **Analysis Modes**: Temporal Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Strategic Positioning  
- **Backend Engine**: 6-phase comprehensive analysis system with advanced pattern recognition
- **Real-time Analysis**: Actual Convex backend processing with visual progress indicators
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Multi-dimensional analysis covering psychological, strategic, and predictive aspects
- **Database Integration**: Full schema support for complex temporal relationship data
