## Session Commits
- 11862b4 feat: complete profile page redesign with business frameworks and Enneagram analysis (starting point)

## Current Session: Navigation Order & Simulator Enhancement

### Completed Tasks

1. **✅ Tab Order Change**
   - Swapped "TARGETS" and "UPLOAD" order in navigation
   - Updated both desktop navbar and mobile sidebar
   - UPLOAD now appears before TARGETS in menu order

2. **✅ Name Standardization** 
   - Replaced all instances of "The Prince / Child / Weak" with "The Prince"
   - Updated in both archetypes.tsx and simulator.tsx files
   - Simplified naming convention for consistency

3. **✅ Precise Target Simulation**
   - Added simulation mode toggle: Generic Archetypes vs Precise Targets
   - Integrated real conversation analysis data into simulator
   - Created dynamic personality generation from analyzed target data
   - Added target selection interface showing actual uploaded conversations
   - Implemented createTargetPersonality function that builds realistic investor personalities from analysis data
   - Added proper conditional query handling for target analysis data
   - Enhanced chat header to show whether using generic archetype or precise target model

### Technical Implementation Details

**Simulator Enhancement Features:**
- **Dual Mode Operation:** Users can now choose between generic archetypes or precise models based on uploaded conversations
- **Real Data Integration:** Precise target mode uses actual personality matrix, vulnerabilities, and communication patterns from analysis
- **Dynamic Personality Generation:** createTargetPersonality function converts analysis data into realistic conversation patterns
- **Enhanced UI:** Clear mode selection with button toggles and different visual indicators
- **Improved Chat Experience:** Chat header shows whether interacting with generic archetype or precise target model

**Code Changes:**
- Modified WarRoomSimulator component to support dual simulation modes
- Added targetAnalysis query using api.analysis.getAnalysis
- Created sophisticated personality mapping from analysis data to conversation patterns  
- Enhanced conversation state management for both generic and precise modes
- Improved error handling and conditional rendering

### Current Status
**Application State:** Navigation reordered per user request, name standardization complete, and sophisticated dual-mode psychological warfare simulator operational with both generic archetypes and precise target models.

**Key Innovation:** Users can now practice psychological warfare techniques against actual analyzed investor personalities based on real conversation data, providing unprecedented realism in investor interaction training.

### Simulator Features Summary
- **Generic Archetypes:** 5 detailed psychological profiles (Prince, Warrior, Joker, Emperor, Sage) with authentic dialogue patterns
- **Precise Targets:** Dynamic personality models generated from real conversation analysis including trust levels, communication styles, vulnerabilities, and market context
- **Conversation Analytics:** Real-time psychological state tracking with trust/suspicion/engagement meters
- **Scenario Options:** Pitch, negotiation, follow-up, and crisis management scenarios
- **Advanced Psychology:** Trigger detection, conversation phase transitions, and strategic response generation

### Technical Architecture
- Frontend: React + TanStack Router with enhanced state management
- Psychology Engine: Sophisticated trigger analysis and response generation
- Data Integration: Convex analysis.getAnalysis for real investor data
- UI/UX: Ultra-premium cyberpunk interface with matrix green styling
- Conversation AI: Dynamic personality modeling based on actual behavioral analysis

**Last Completed Task:** Successfully implemented dual-mode psychological warfare simulator allowing users to practice against both generic archetypes and precise models based on real analyzed conversation data.
